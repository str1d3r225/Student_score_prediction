# 🎓 Student Score Prediction using Linear & Polynomial Regression

This machine learning project predicts student exam scores based on hours of study using two regression techniques:
- 📈 Linear Regression
- 🧠 Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)

The project includes data analysis, training/testing model performance, and visual comparison.

## 📊 Dataset

A simple dataset with:
- `Hours` — number of study hours
- `Scores` — exam scores

Dataset file: `student_scores.csv`

---

## 📌 Project Structure

- `Student_Score_Prediction.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with full code, EDA, and models
- `student_scores.csv` — input dataset
- (Optional) `requirements.txt` — package dependencies

---

## 📈 Models & Evaluation

### ✅ Linear Regression
- Trained on 80% of the dataset
- MAE, MSE, R² evaluated

### ✅ Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)
- Better fit for non-linear relationships
- Compared against linear model visually and numerically

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

---

## 📎 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure the dataset file (`student_scores.csv`) is in the same directory
3. Open and run the notebook:  
   `Student_Score_Prediction.ipynb`
